# InstaStories - AspectRatio Fixed (BlackBars)

If you have an android phone that has a aspect ratio bigger than 16:9 and used the Stories from Instagram already, you may have noticed that the picture looks weird.

Well, Instagram, trying to deal with the huge amount of screen sizes, decided to force all the stories to be in 16:9 aspect ratio. However, for users of IOS rival, it implemented it in an unintelligent way. They force the image that you will post to cover the entire screen of *YOUR* phone and then apply two black bars to the image, so, the final image will be in a 16:9 aspect ratio.

-And, what if I take a photo in the native camera app? The picture will be already in 16:9 if I choose, right?

-Yes, but it's not that simple. Instagram will always zoom your image (cutting the edges) and than will place the back bars.

This black bars that Instagram places on your image is always with the same size (in each phone), so, if you could places your photo, with a pinch gesture, in the right place and without this annoying zoom, there will be nothing to instagram cover with their black bars, right?

With all this in mind, I developed this app. Once inside it, you will open your gallery and choose the desired image (choose only images that are already 16:9, otherwise it will stretch and distort it). It will resize your image to the right size for your screen and will add black bars (similar to those of Instagram itself), so, when you import it into instagram sotories, the image will already be in full screen, so instagram will not cut any piece of it and, how it will already have black bars with the right size, Instagram will place his black bars above them, therefore, without being over anything in the photo.

The app is in a alpha project and it's just working on my Galaxy S9 Plus, but feel free to try it on your own phone.
